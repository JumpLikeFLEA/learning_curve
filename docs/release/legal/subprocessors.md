# Subprocessors

**Colloquiz — https://colloquiz.app** · Version 1.0 · Last updated 2026-08-29

These are the third parties that process personal data on our behalf. The
[Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) links here. Keep this file current — adding a
processor is a change users are entitled to know about.

Each entry names what the provider actually touches in *this* codebase, so the list can be
verified rather than trusted.

## In use today

| Provider | Role | Personal data processed | Location | Transfer basis | Where it appears in the code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Supabase** (Supabase Inc.) | Database, authentication, file storage | Everything: email, password hash, profile, results, groups, duels, notifications, avatars | Ireland (`eu-west-1`), EU | SCCs where applicable | `lib/supabase/*`, all `supabase/migrations/**` |
| **Vercel** (Vercel Inc.) | Application hosting, CDN, serverless execution | Request data in operational logs: IP, user agent, path, timestamp. Processes all request payloads in transit | Region `dub1` (Dublin, IE) | EU–US DPF / SCCs | `vercel.json` |
| **Resend** | Outbound email — **account mail only** (sign-up confirmation, password reset) | Email address, and the message content | EU/US | EU–US DPF / SCCs | Configured as custom SMTP **inside Supabase Auth**; the app holds no API key and sends no mail of its own — see `lib/feedbackNotify.ts` |
| **Google** (Google Ireland Ltd.) | OAuth sign-in — **only if the user chooses it** | Email address, account identifier, name and picture as returned by the provider | EU/US | EU–US DPF / SCCs | `app/(auth)/AuthScreen.tsx`, `app/auth/callback/route.ts` |
| **Discord** (Discord Inc.) | OAuth sign-in — **only if the user chooses it** | Same as above | US | SCCs | `app/(auth)/AuthScreen.tsx`, `app/auth/callback/route.ts` |
| **Discord** (webhook) | Operator notification when new in-app feedback arrives | The feedback text, which may contain whatever the user typed | US | SCCs | `lib/feedbackNotify.ts`, `FEEDBACK_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` — optional; feedback is stored either way |

## Added as part of the 1.0 release

| Provider | Role | Personal data processed | Location | Transfer basis | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sentry** (Functional Software Inc.) | Error monitoring | Technical error reports: stack trace, URL, browser. **`sb-*` cookies, Cookie/Authorization headers, email and IP are scrubbed before send** — `lib/sentryScrub.ts`, wired into `beforeSend` in `sentry.server.config.ts` / `sentry.edge.config.ts` / `instrumentation-client.ts`; `sendDefaultPii` is off | Select the EU region (`de`) when creating the project | EU region / SCCs | ☑ wired in code — inert until `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set in prod (EU-region project) |
| **Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights** | Aggregate page views and Web Vitals | None identifying. **Cookieless** — this is why the Service needs no cookie banner | EU | — | ☑ live — `<Analytics />` + `<SpeedInsights />` in `app/layout.tsx` (`@vercel/analytics`, `@vercel/speed-insights`) |

## Not a subprocessor of personal data

| Provider | Why it is listed | Why it is not a subprocessor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anthropic** | Drafts candidate quiz questions | Receives a subject and topic only. **No user data of any kind is sent**, and no user data is used for training. See `lib/generator/llm.ts` — the payload is authored content, never a profile, result or answer |

## Change procedure

1. Add or amend the row here **before** the provider goes live.
2. Confirm a DPA is in place (usually accepting the provider's standard terms).
3. Bump the version and date at the top of this file and of the Privacy Policy.
4. If the change materially affects users, notify them in-app per Terms §10.
