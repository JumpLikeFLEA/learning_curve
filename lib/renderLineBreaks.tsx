/**
 * Shared line-break / paragraph primitives for the math-aware text pipeline.
 *
 * Only the three multi-line theory fields (prose.body, callout.body,
 * example.statement) legitimately carry `\n`; every other authored string is
 * strictly single-line by schema, so calling either function below on such a
 * string is a no-op.
 *
 * DESIGN — "approach A": paragraph boundary lives OUTSIDE segmentation, line
 * break (`<br>`) lives INSIDE the text segment, segmentMath stays untouched
 * between them. This is required because inline math `\(…\)` must flow inside
 * a paragraph — per-segment `<p>` wrapping fragments that flow.
 *
 * The pipeline every renderer follows (server HTML, learner JSX, editor
 * preview JSX — must be byte-identical):
 *
 *   raw string
 *    → splitParagraphs (split on blank lines, drop empties)
 *      → segmentMath(paragraph) → text | inline | block
 *        → text segment: split on single \n, interleave <br>
 *      → wrap each paragraph's segments in ONE <p>
 *        EXCEPT: a paragraph containing any block (`\[…\]`) segment renders
 *        WITHOUT a <p> wrapper (block math cannot nest in <p>).
 *
 * This module knows nothing about segmentation or KaTeX — it only handles the
 * paragraph split and the single-\n → <br> transform within one text segment.
 * Inline markup (**bold**) is delegated to lib/inlineMarkup per line, after the
 * \n split, so a marker only ever sees one math-free, break-free line.
 * Kept dep-free (react only) so both server and client bundles can share it.
