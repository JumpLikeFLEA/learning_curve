/**
 * Course theory content — the `TheoryBlock` union and its zod schema, shared by
 * the importer (`scripts/import-course.ts`) and the renderer (the stage page).
 *
 * Theory has NO inline formatting in v1: text segments render as plain JSX text
 * nodes, so there is no bold/italic/link/inline-code INSIDE a prose block. The
 * alternative is a markdown pipeline, which the math-rendering design deliberately
 * rejected (an `_italic_` rule over raw text would destroy every `x_1` and
 * `\sum_{i=0}` in the corpus). Formatting is therefore STRUCTURAL — `list` and
 * `definition` exist because a math text needs condition lists and a bolded term
 * at the point of definition, and each costs one union member plus a renderer
 * branch rather than a parser. Math still embeds via `\(…\)` / `\[…\]`, handled
 * by `segmentMath` (lib/richText.ts) at render time.

// Every authored string is single-line by default: no C0 control character

// C0 makes the check TOTAL. It is also the belt-and-braces second line of
// defence behind the pre-parse backslash lint (lib/courseLint.ts): by the time
// zod runs, `JSON.parse` has already turned a single-backslash
// "\ne"/"\to"/"\theta" into a control char + letter, so rejecting C0 catches
// those even if the content arrived by a route that skipped the raw-byte lint.

// still reject tabs and every other C0 char. Every other field (quiz stems,
